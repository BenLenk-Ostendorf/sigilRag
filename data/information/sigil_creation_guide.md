# Manual City Seal Creation Guide

This guide explains how to manually create city seals.

## Step-by-Step Creation Process

### 1. Collect City Data
To create a seal for a city, you need the city's data:

- Color of the state flag ([https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaggen_und_Wappen_der_L%C3%A4nder_der_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaggen_und_Wappen_der_L%C3%A4nder_der_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland))
- Population class (over 500,000 or over 1 million inhabitants 
- Capital status (Federal capital, State capital, or Bonn)
- Location in the state (North, South, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest, Central or City state)
- Letter(s) of the vehicle license plate
- Coordinates (approximate latitude and longitude)
- Year of founding

### 2. Choose the State Background
The State Background is determined by the state of the city and contains the colors of the state flag ([https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaggen_und_Wappen_der_L%C3%A4nder_der_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaggen_und_Wappen_der_L%C3%A4nder_der_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland)). For example: Bavaria is blue-white.

### 3. Choose the Population Frame
The Population Frame is determined by the population of the city (population class).

- For cities with over 1 million inhabitants: Use the two-colored border with green spikes.
- For cities with 500,000 to 1 million inhabitants: Use the two-colored border with elevations.
- For cities with less than 500,000 inhabitants: Use the single-colored border.

### 4. Choose the Capital Crown (if applicable)
The Capital Crown is only used for capitals and Bonn.

- For federal capitals: Use the crown with two underlines in inverted German flag colors.
- For state capitals: Use the crown with the red underline.
- For the former federal capital, use exclusively the crown.
- For other cities: No Capital Crown

### 5. Choose the Orientation Circle
The Location Circles represent the approximate geographical location of the city within the state. The black circle is in the background, the yellow circle is in the foreground. If the city is a city-state, use the completely yellow filled circle.

### 6. Add Text Elements

#### Short Registration Plate
On the left side are the letters of the vehicle license plate of the respective city to make it precisely identifiable.

#### Coordinate Rectangle
The approximate coordinates of the city are given on the right side in the format "LAT|LON" (e.g., "48|11").

## Example
For the city of Munich:

- State Background: Blue White
- Population Frame: Two-colored Black-Green with spikes
- Capital Crown: Crown with red underline
- Orientation Circle: South
- Founding Center: "12" (founding year 1158, shortened to the first two digits)
- Short Registration Plate: "M"
- Coordinate Rectangle: "48|11"
