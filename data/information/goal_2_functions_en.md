# The Individual Components of a Seal

A city seal consists of various components, each fulfilling a specific function:

## 1. State Background
The background of the seal is determined by the federal state of the city and contains the colors of the state flag. Example: Bavaria is blue-white. When there are common color combinations (for example red-white), the colors are oriented to the respective state flag.

Examples of State Backgrounds:

- Bavaria (blue-white)
- Berlin (red-white)
- Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (black-yellow)

## 2. Population Frame
The frame is determined by the population of the city:

- For cities with over 1 million inhabitants: Two-colored border with green spikes
- For cities with 500,000 to 1 million inhabitants: Two-colored border with elevations
- For cities with less than 500,000 inhabitants: Single-colored border

## 3. Capital Crown
The Capital Crown is only used for capitals and Bonn:

- For federal capitals: Crown with two underlines in inverted German flag colors
- For state capitals: Crown with red underline
- For the former federal capital: Crown only
- For other cities: No Capital Crown

## 4. Orientation Circle/Location Circle
The Location Circles represent the approximate geographic location of the city within the federal state. The black circle is in the background, the yellow circle in the foreground. For city-states (like Berlin), the completely yellow filled circle is used.

## 5. Text Elements

### Short Registration Plate
On the left side are the letters of the vehicle registration plate of the respective city for precise identification.

### Coordinate Rectangle
On the right side, the approximate coordinates of the city are given in the format "LAT|LON" (e.g. "48|11").

### Founding Center
In the center of the seal stands the founding year of the city (shortened to the first two digits).
